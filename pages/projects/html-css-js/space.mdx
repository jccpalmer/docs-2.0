## II. About

### Built with

- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [NASA APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/)

NASA, short for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is a government agency dedicated to advancing space exploration, aeronautics, and conducting scientific research. One of their endeavors is the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API, which lets users access NASA's daily selection of captivating images and informative descriptions.

This web application leverages the APOD API to explore NASA's curated collection of celestial visuals. With this application, users can browse through the archive featuring media from past dates, each accompanied by their respective titles, descriptions, and copyright details.

The media showcased on the APOD ranges from photographs of distant galaxies and nebulae to videos, including noteworthy moments like the Perseverance rover's Mars landing. This web application serves as a user-friendly gateway to access and appreciate these images and videos.

By using the APOD API, this web application provides a streamlined interface that allows users to to view the wonders of NASA's astronomical discoveries and gain insights into the vast cosmos.

## III. Motivation

When I began this project, I wanted to create an simple web application using the fundamentals of web development and an entertaining API. Discovering NASA's APOD API sparked my inspiration, and I envisioned a site that would beautifully display this captivating content.

My plan was to rely solely on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without the use of frameworks or additional tools. I aimed to enhance the site's interactivity by leveraging JavaScript. By combining these elements, my objective wass to deliver an appealing website that showcased NASA's APOD imagery while adhering to the principles of simplicity and usability in web development.
