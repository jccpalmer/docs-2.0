Global Chemistry serves as an open source platform where writing the molecules directly allows for the name to not be ambiguous to what a chemical is is anymore and allows for full transparency. The hopes of this project is to be a base for the population to govern how the chemicals in use for things like Food, Clothing, Environment, Materials, Drugs, War and a lot more are beneficial for all of us.
